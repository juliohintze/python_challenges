# Create a BankAccount class. It should have a account number and balance.
# It should also be possible to deposit and withdraw money from it.
# Every time the user deposits money, the balance increases.
# Every time the user withdraws money, the balance decreases.
# Then create an object from that class. Deposit some money to it and
# then print its balance.
