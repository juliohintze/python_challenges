# Keep insisting for numbers from the user. Each time the user gives a number, print the cumulative sum of all the given numbers so far.
# Ex.: The first time, the user gives the number 1, so you print 1.
# The second time, the user gives the number 5, so you print 6, because 1 + 5 = 6.
# The third time, the user gives the number 3, so you print 9, because 6 + 3 = 9.
