# Create a Pet class.
# A Pet can have a name, can be hungry and can eat.
# A Pet always starts hungry.
# When a Pet eats, print that it's eating (use its name in the print message).
# After a Pet eats, it shouldn't be hungry anymore.
# Then create an object from that class, give it a name and make it eat.
