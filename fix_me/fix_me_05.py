# This code is supposed to get a number from the user
# and print its multiplication table, but it just seems
# to repeat the number that the user enters instead of
# actually doing the math.

# num = input("Give me a number and I'll print its the multiplication table\n")
# count = 1

# while count <= 12:
#   print(num, "x", count, "=", num * count)
#   count += 1
