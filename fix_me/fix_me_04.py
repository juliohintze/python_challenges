# This code is supposed to add two numbers together,
# but it seems to concatenate the two numbers.
# For example, if the user enters 1 and 5, it should
# print 6, because 1 + 5 = 6, but it's printing 15.

# print("Give me two numbers and I'll add them together.")
# num1 = input("First number: ")
# num2 = input("Second number: ")
# result = num1 + num2
# print("Result:", result)
